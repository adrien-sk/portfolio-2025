Here we are, I just decided to update my personal website. It was outdated and I needed a change, something new. I also wanted something more simple and minimalistic.

But besides that, I have also learned a lot since then, and touched a lot of new topics. Sometimes I feel that this knowledge is hard to organize in my head, and I was trying to get an idea of how to organize it without just having notes and papers or files on my computer that I'll probably never look at again.

I've always thought about writing articles and having a blog, but I didn't have the need at the time. Today I feel that this could be a great opportunity for me.

It could help me organize my notes and categorize all the topics I'm learning and playing around with. Very good if future me needs to go back to something I struggled with or found interesting in the past!

It will help me learn and understand everything better. Don't we say, "If you want to explain something to someone else, you have to understand it first" ?
This is a chance to not only go over some topics, but to go a level deeper to get it into my head.

Of course, if this can be helpful to anyone out there, that would be a win.

If you, reader, are interested in my profile and want to learn more about me, this is also a chance to get a glimpse into my thought process and experiences.

For all these reasons, I think it is a good idea to document my work and career in this blog.

And maybe, all those moments will not be lost in time ... like tears in rain.
