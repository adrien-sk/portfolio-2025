**Full-Stack Software Engineer** with a **Master's degree** and **11 years' experience** across multiple languages and platforms, eager to learn and constantly striving for improvement.

I am curious by nature and enjoy exploring a wide variety of topics and areas of expertise, whilst having a strong results-oriented and 'get things done' mindset.

Iâ€™m also a **4th Dan** Kendo teacher who has traveled 8 times to Japan, learning the language and the culture.
